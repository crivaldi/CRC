Hello,

Here are the commands for BWA, easiest way to ensure everything works is that you cd into the directory where your 2 fastq files and reference files are, or copy them all into bwa folder:

type bwa if works yay

if doesn't - move into a global directory - 

./bwa instead of just bwa runs as .exe

1) Index your reference

bwa index reference.fa

After this there are 2 ways to go about the next step: BWA-mem

New way
2)
bwa mem reference.fa end1.fq end2.fq > sample.sam

Old way (which I normally use and works)
2)
bwa aln reference.fa end1.fq > end1.sai
bwa aln reference.fa end2.fq > end2.sai

bwa sampe reference.fa end1.sai end2.sai end1.fq end2.fq > sample.sam

Once you have the sam files, you would need samtools to convert sam to bam. Download and install http://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/latest/download?source=files

once downloaded: 

3) index reference for samtools:

samtools faidx reference.fa

4) Convert sam to bam file

samtools view -bS sample.sam >sample.bam

I recommend adding -F 4 to this command as it reduces file size by getting rid of all unmapped reads. So the command would be
samtools view -bS -F 4 sample.sam >sample.bam

5) Sort your bam file
samtools sort sample.bam sample.sorted

6) Index your bam file
samtools index sample.sorted.bam

Good luck!
