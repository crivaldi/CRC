#CRC Scripts/One liners
==================

## These scripts are miscellaneous collections of one liners and for loops that I've used on the Notre Dame HPC.
Some are job scripts (SGE-scheduler), and others are written for either bash (most of the time) or tsch. 

### Note: 
This is not a particularly well or regularly maintained repository - I've chosen to make it public because I got a lot of the code
(or a lot of the ideas behind the code at least) from other peoples' public code. It may not work for your situation but 
feel free to borrow and modify as needed.
